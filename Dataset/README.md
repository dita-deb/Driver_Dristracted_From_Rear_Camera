# Organizing Dataset

## Reordering by Labeling Data
- **Goal**: Ensure the files are named consistently with leading zeros to maintain chronological order.
- Used `rename_files.py` to rename files, such as changing `"0.png"` to `"000.png"` for proper sorting.

### Prerequisites
- **Python installed**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.  
  [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed.
- **Backup your data**: Itâ€™s recommended to back up your files before running any renaming script.

### Instructions to Use `renumber.py`:
1. **Open the terminal** (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows).
2. **Navigate to the folder** where `rename_files.py` is saved:
   ```bash
   cd path_to_your_script
